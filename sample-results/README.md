## Description
Sample results from an execution of the `run_all_examples.sh` script. Each experimental subdirectory contains the following files:
* JSON Configuration file used to configure and visualize the experiment
* CSV grid log output of the experimental simulation
* A diagram showing the experimental configuration and cell coordinates
* Simulation visualization images for:
    * Initial state (`t=0`)
    * Final state (`t=96`)
    * Notable simulation steps captured for analysis
* A video of the entire simulation

## Examples
Examples in this directory are organized as follows:

### Example 1: High Occupany 
* Occupancy: 44/48 workstations occupied
* Configuration 1: Scattered occupancy pattern
    * Variation 1: Occupancy sensors disabled
    * Variation 2: Occupancy sensors enabled
* Configuration 2: Condensed occupancy pattern 
    * Variation 1: Occupancy sensors disabled
    * Variation 2: Occupancy sensors enabled
    
### Example 2: Half Occupany 
* Occupancy: 24/48 workstations occupied
* Configuration 1: Scattered occupancy pattern
    * Variation 1: Occupancy sensors disabled
    * Variation 2: Occupancy sensors enabled
* Configuration 2: Condensed occupancy pattern 
    * Variation 1: Occupancy sensors disabled
    * Variation 2: Occupancy sensors enabled
    
### Example 3: Low Occupany 
* Occupancy: 8/48 workstations occupied
* Configuration 1: Scattered occupancy pattern
    * Variation 1: Occupancy sensors disabled
    * Variation 2: Occupancy sensors enabled
* Configuration 2: Condensed occupancy pattern 
    * Variation 1: Occupancy sensors disabled
    * Variation 2: Occupancy sensors enabled
