# Presentation

## S1: Title
* Hello

## S2: Post-Pandemic Work Policies and Practices
* Introduce the topic of energy waste in buildings
* Why it is important to study
* Why Cell-DEVS is aprticularly suited

## S3: Research Questions
## S4: Core Activities
## S5: Building Information Modeling (BIM)
## S3: Corporate Building Energy Consumption and Waste
## S3: Existing Cell-DEVS M&S
## S3: Extending the Models
## S3: Research Questions
* Literature Review
    * The work I've found
* Avenues of Extension
    * I don't want to replicate the work already achieved; instead, I want to use it to inform my work as a basis.
    * Using the findings of the previous models and simulation, I want to take the results (ie. amount of CO2 produced by occupants and the amount detectable by sensors) and incorporate that as a model feature to study HVAC and energy waste in corporate office spaces, conducting experiments specifically to see what happens on Work-From-Home days when an office is sparsely populated. I would like to see how much energy is wasted, and if there are any viable solutions to reduce energy waste while minimizing inconveniences to workers.
    * Could have an effect on work policies (ie. maybe we don't have hybrid days, or on hybrid days, only a portion of the office is climate-controlled).
    * No actual measurement of energy expenditure (money or energy) is conducted in these studies.
    * I would like to associate energy expenditures with different configurations and practices to be able to quantify how different scenarios affect energy usage and waste.

## S4: Current Results
* Discuss results from the research
* Note general trends there
* How can I use these results to advance towards my own hypothesis

* Applicability to my Project
    * Have each occupant generate some form of discernible output to assist in the automation of state changes of HVAC and lighting
    * Each occupant will generate the following output:
        1. CO2 - for influencing HVAC via CO2 sensors
        2. Templerature - for influencing HVAC via temperature sensors
        3. Movement - for influencing lights via motion sensors
* Experiments
    1. A regular workday of high occupancy
        * Establish a baseline of energy consumption
    2. A Work-From-Home day of low occupancy
        * Everyone is spread out
    3. A Work-From-Home day of low occupancy
        * Everyone is consolidated
* Compare these to see how much energy wasted on HVACing a whole floor in 2, vs. maybe just a small section in 3. Or, measure it by cost per person.

* HVAC systems generate around 50% of building energy usage


## S5: Conclusions
* What's next?
* What I would like to deliver for the final report
* Hopeful implications of my research
