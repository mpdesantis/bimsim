## Energy Waste in Buildings Due to Occupant Behaviour
* Pan, Song, et al. “Energy Waste in Buildings Due to Occupant Behaviour.” Energy Procedia, vol. 105, 2017, pp. 2233–38, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.636.

* Abstract: Occupants’ behaviour has a significant impact on the energy performance of buildings. A good understanding of how occupants use a building provides a possibility of promoting the building’s energy efficiency through changing occupant behaviour. Building simulation has been adopted as a useful method by building engineers for quantifying the effects of changing occupant behaviour on the building’s energy consumption and indoor environment. However, due to the lack of real measured data with respect to how occupants use the building, such simulation work has relied on assumed behavioural patterns, which significantly reduces the reliability of the predicted results. This paper describes a longitudinal study monitoring occupants’ heating, window opening and cooling behaviour in an office building throughout summer, transitional and winter periods. These behavioural data were then used to drive dynamic building performance simulation to predict the energy saving potential of changing behaviour. Comparison with predicted results by assumed behavioural patterns reflected that improperly assumed behavioural patterns may either overestimate or underestimate the energy saving potential of changing behaviour, especially for unextreme behaviours.
* In order to capture occupants’ actual behaviour in buildings and identify energy wasteful behaviour based on field data, a longitudinal study was carried out in an office building located in Beijing, China, with field monitoring of occupants’ use of window, heating and cooling systems. 


## Minimizing Building Energy Waste by Detecting and Addressing HVAC Issues
* Agarwal, Anshul, et al. “Minimizing Building Energy Waste by Detecting and Addressing HVAC Issues.” Soft Computing: Theories and Applications, vol. 627, Springer, 2023, pp. 755–64, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-9858-4_64.

* Abstract: Every building is equipped with heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to ensure user comfort. These are acknowledged to be the primary factors to the structures’ excessive energy use. Inefficient operation of these HVAC systems frequently results in a significant amount of energy loss. Therefore, it is essential that these always perform effectively. To address this problem, the research focuses on a novel framework for detecting HVAC problems in buildings, such that energy consumption waste due to HVAC defects may be reduced. Existing techniques suffer from challenges such as the deployment of expensive and specialized gear, manual examination of HVAC systems and the use of vast volumes of training data for fault detection. However, the proposed framework overcomes these obstacles and is applied to a building’s forty-eight HVACs (situated in Mumbai, India). A total of thirty-one HVAC systems were determined to be defective. It was noticed that the malfunctioning of these HVACs led to a 48% increase in energy usage.
* HVAC systems generate around 50% of building energy usage



## Systematic data mining-based framework to discover potential energy waste patterns in residential buildings
* Li, Jun, et al. “Systematic Data Mining-Based Framework to Discover Potential Energy Waste Patterns in Residential Buildings.” Energy and Buildings, vol. 199, 2019, pp. 562–78, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2019.07.032.

* Abstract: Energy feedback systems are recently proposed to help occupants understand and improve their energy use behavior. Despite many potential benefits, the question remains, whether useful and straightforward knowledge are transferred to the occupants about their energy use patterns. In this context, the key is to develop methodologies that can effectively analyze occupants’ energy use behavior and distinguish their energy-inefficient behavior (if any). Previous studies seldom considered the dynamics of occupancy, which may result in misleading information to the occupants and inefficacy in recognizing the actual wasteful behavior. To fill this gap, this study proposes a data mining framework with a combination of change point analysis (CPA), cluster analysis, and association rule mining (ARM) to explore the relation- ship between occupancy and building energy consumption, aiming at identifying potential energy waste patterns and to provide useful feedback to the occupants. To demonstrate the capability of the developed framework, it was applied to datasets collected from two different apartments located in Lyon, France.  Results indicate that different energy waste patterns can be effectively discovered in both apartments through the proposed framework and a substantial amount of energy savings can be achieved by modi- fying occupants’ energy use behavior. The proposed framework is flexible and can be adaptive to house- holds with different occupancy patterns and habitual energy-use behavior. Nevertheless, the discovered energy saving potentials and benchmark values are limited to the apartments considered in this study and similar analysis based on the proposed framework are needed in wider building stocks to explore its generalizability.
* The main objective of this work is to develop a novel and gen- eral DM-based framework to identify the potential energy waste patterns in residential buildings by combining energy consumption and dynamic occupancy behavior. The proposed framework aims at (1) explicitly exploring the relationship between occupancy and energy consumption patterns; (2) developing benchmarking base- lines that can discover actual energy waste patterns; (3) differen- tiating the irregular energy use from the energy waste patterns so as to give more practical feedback. 
* Previous studies reported that 70% of lighting consumption could be saved in an institutional building if such wasteful behavior is avoided [25]. 
* Based on the identified matching/mismatching groups through cluster analysis, in this study ARM is performed on each sub clus- ters, to extract a set of rules which can be categorized into several categories: (1) rules that explain the positive relationship between occupancy, energy consumption are considered as normal behav- ior rules (e.g. high occupancy level with high energy consump- tion; (2) rules describing low occupancy level with relatively high- energy consumption are considered as abnormal behavior rules, as the energy consumption in these rules lies in a relatively high range, which is different from the normal behavior rules. This is because if the energy consumption is higher than the energy con- sumption value specified in the benchmarking rules when occu- pancy level is in the lowest range for a defined duration, it hints a high chance for energy wastage; (3) rules that indicates the re- lationship between the lowest occupancy level in each period with the lowest energy consumption are considered as the benchmark- ing rules. Though these rules also can be categorized as ‘normal rules’, it is categorized as ‘benchmarking rules’ since such rules serve as the baseline to identify the actual and more reasonable
energy waste patterns.

# Sample Projects
* Sample projects recommended by professor.

## Elephant Room
* BIM: Building Information Modeling
    * Useful to architects, designers, and fabricators
    * Helps model occupant behaviour to aid in design and implementation of actual buildings and structures for use by occupants
    * Useful for studying energy patterns in an occupied building, and how to minimize energy waste with different occupancies
* IFC: Industry Foundation Classes
* Behavioural modeling of occupants
    * Occupants are given probabilities to determine behaviour
    * Occupants may stay still, move in different directions, etc.
* Will be useful for modeling occupants inside of a space.

## Room Evacuation
* Not great.
* Maybe some relevant Cadmium V2 logic for local computing function, if we need to determine proximities to special static input/output cells.



## CELL-DEVS MODELS FOR CO2 SENSORS LOCATIONS IN CLOSED SPACES
* Khalil, Hoda, et al. “Cell-DEVS Models for CO2 Sensors Locations in Closed Spaces.” 2020 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC), IEEE, 2020, pp. 692–703, https://doi.org/10.1109/WSC48552.2020.9383937.

* Aim is to find ways to reduce energy consumption in closed spaces with minimal disruptions to occupant comfort.
* Carbon dioxide sensors are used to measure occupancy, relying on developed relationships between CO2 output and the number and behaviour of occupants.
* HVAC: Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning
    * One of the most expensive and energy consumptive elements of a building.
    * Standard HVAC systems allow occupants to change settings themselves; however, this is is often inefficient, as occupant behaviour is unreliable.
    * Demand-driven HVAC is explored as a more viable and energy-efficient solution, as it automatically regulates HVAC services based on data collected from sensors.
* CO2 sensors
    * Advantages:
        * Often already present as part of building safety codes
        * Non-intrusive
        * Simple
    * Disadvantages:
        * Latency in detection
        * Not great for detecting the precise number of discrete occupants
        * Highly sensitive to configuration, positioning, etc.
* Modeling
    * Parameters:
        * Room dimensions
        * Room configuration
        * CO2 sensor location
        * Windows
        * Occupants
* Sensor Behaviour
    1. Binary detection: is the room occupied or not
        * May be useful for binary things, like lighting
        * Not particularly useful for continuous variables like heat, AC, etc.
    2. Estimate the number of occupants
        * Harder to achieve reliably, especially with CO2 sensors
        * Obviously more useful if you have an integer rather than a bool
* Focus of the paper is two parameters:
    1. CO2 sensor placement
    2. Room configuration
* Really, this paper is less about how to improve energy efficiency, but more about how to accurately develop models using CO2 sensors in particular ways.
* Simulation shows how accurately CO2 levels and patterns detected by sensors correlate to occupancy numbers in rooms of certain configurations.
* This is __Occupant Detection__ using CO2 sensors.
* Applicability to my Project
    * Have each occupant generate some form of discernible output to assist in the automation of state changes of HVAC and lighting
    * Each occupant will generate the following output:
        1. CO2 - for influencing HVAC via CO2 sensors
        2. Templerature - for influencing HVAC via temperature sensors
        3. Movement - for influencing lights via motion sensors

## Cell-DEVS CO2 Models With Occupants and Ducts
* Al-Saeedi, Mohammed, and Gabriel A. Wainer. “Cell-DEVS CO2 Models With Occupants and Ducts.” 2022 IEEE/ACM 26th International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications (DS-RT), IEEE, 2022, pp. 112–18, https://doi.org/10.1109/DS-RT55542.2022.9932051.

* Builds on Hoda Khalil's research above.
    * Uses the results of her research ion regards to CCO2 detection to be able to generate 2D and 3D models with validated information.
* Adds ducts between rooms.
* "It is worth noting that the objective of this research is not to estimate the number of occupants in the room based on CO2 levels, but to provide a mechanism for studying the effect of the space settings on the measurement and the dispersion behavior of CO2."
* "The results show that implementing ducts between rooms and with the presence of vents can efficiently reduce the concentration of CO2 inside rooms."


# Presentation

## S1: Title
* Hello

## S2: Introduction
* Introduce the topic of energy waste in buildings
* Why it is important to study
* Why Cell-DEVS is aprticularly suited

## S3: Core Activities
* Literature Review
    * The work already done from the shit Wainer gave me
    * The work I've found
* Avenues of Extension
    * I don't want to replicate the work already achieved; instead, I want to use it to inform my work as a basis.
    * Using the findings of the previous models and simulation, I want to take the results (ie. amount of CO2 produced by occupants and the amount detectable by sensors) and incorporate that as a model feature to study HVAC and energy waste in corporate office spaces, conducting experiments specifically to see what happens on Work-From-Home days when an office is sparesely populated. I would like to see how much energy is wasted, and if there are any viable solutions to reduce energy waste while minimizing inconveniences to workers.
    * Could have an effect on work policies (ie. maybe we don't have hybrid days, or on hybrid days, only a portion of the office is climate-controlled).
    * No actual measurement of energy expenditure (money or energy) is conducted in these studies.
    * I would like to associate energy expenditures with different configurations and practices to be able to quantify how different scenarios affect energy usage and waste.

## S4: Current Results
* Discuss results from the research
* Note general trends there
* How can I use these results to advance towards my own hypothesis

* Applicability to my Project
    * Have each occupant generate some form of discernible output to assist in the automation of state changes of HVAC and lighting
    * Each occupant will generate the following output:
        1. CO2 - for influencing HVAC via CO2 sensors
        2. Templerature - for influencing HVAC via temperature sensors
        3. Movement - for influencing lights via motion sensors
* Experiments
    1. A regular workday of high occupancy
        * Establish a baseline of energy consumption
    2. A Work-From-Home day of low occupancy
        * Everyone is spread out
    3. A Work-From-Home day of low occupancy
        * Everyone is consolidated
* Compare these to see how much energy wasted on HVACing a whole floor in 2, vs. maybe just a small section in 3. Or, measure it by cost per person.

* HVAC systems generate around 50% of building energy usage
